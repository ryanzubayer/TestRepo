# Code Refactor 
This is my first weekly challenge for the UCF Coding Boot Camp. The following challenge is expressed in the form of an on-the-job ticket and the focus is on accessibility. I was given starter code with HTML and CSS and a mockup of the website for visual reference.

Challenge

AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

Guidelines
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
